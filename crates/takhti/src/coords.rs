//! The logical↔physical coordinate boundary.
//!
//! Takhti's canonical coordinate space is **integer physical pixels**: layout,
//! the Lua API, and rendering all speak physical. Wayland protocol objects
//! (xdg configure sizes, wl_output geometry, pointer events) speak *logical*
//! coordinates. Every conversion between the two lives in this module and
//! nowhere else — that is what keeps client buffers sampled 1:1 on the pixel
//! grid (sharp text) regardless of output scale.
//!
//! Currently one scale applies to all outputs (`takhti.settings { scale }`),
//! so protocol-logical is simply physical divided by that scale. Per-output
//! scales later only change which scale each helper is called with.
