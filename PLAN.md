# tomoe — parity plan

Working tracker toward the DESIGN.md vision: **niri's performance,
Hyprland's features, ShojiWM's configurability**. DESIGN.md holds doctrine
and locked decisions; this file holds the concrete gap list and the order
we close it in. Check items off as they land; re-audit against `ref/`
when a milestone completes.

## Where we are (2026-07)

Done and working:

- winit + TTY (DRM/GBM/libinput/libseat) backends, VT switching,
  multi-output (side-by-side), per-display mode selection,
  explicit sync (`backend/tty.rs`)
- Multi-GPU (niri-shape: every seat GPU opened, rendering pinned to the
  primary render node via `GpuManager`, cross-device copies for scanout;
  `--drm-device` overrides the render GPU) and output/GPU hotplug
  (udev → `DrmScanner` diff → connect/disconnect → `outputs_changed`);
  zero connected outputs is a wait-state, not an error
- niri-style per-output redraw state machine + estimated-vblank timer,
  damage-tracked rendering, frame-callback throttling
- Plane offloading: fullscreen direct scanout (primary plane, zero-copy)
  + hardware cursor plane via DrmCompositor frame flags; per-surface
  render/scanout dmabuf feedback steers clients onto flippable formats
  (NVIDIA compressed modifiers excluded). Overlay planes off. Tearing:
  `wp_tearing_control_v1` + async page flips via the smithay fork
  (`y0usaf/smithay#tomoe-tearing`), gated by `settings.tearing`, with
  the estimated-vblank bypass so tearing presents follow commit rate.
  Live verification pending (see M3 §4)
- Physical-first coordinate doctrine (`coords.rs`), fractional-scale +
  viewporter, dmabuf, layer-shell, xdg-decoration (+ KDE legacy),
  data-device/clipboard, primary selection, xdg-output,
  pointer-constraints + relative-pointer, presentation-time
- Lua runtime: binds (Mod-agnostic), spawn, settings (gaps/scale/border/
  displays/focus-follows-mouse), window handles + queued ops, hooks
  (open/close/focus/outputs/pointer button+axis, hover enter/leave),
  pointer grabs, world camera (`set_view`), hot reload with state
  persistence (`tomoe.on_reload(name, save, restore)`: save runs in the
  outgoing VM, values cross as JSON, restore runs in the fresh VM;
  `on_window_open` replay is the fallback when no restore ran), window
  rules (`tomoe.rule` matcher registry + `tomoe.rules_for` merge +
  apply-fns at window open), dispatch watchdog (doctrine 02: every Lua
  entry — hooks, binds, IPC handlers, config load — is time-boxed by
  `settings.watchdog_ms`, default 1000; a count debug hook checks a
  wall-clock deadline and aborts the entry with a normal Lua error.
  LuaJIT lesson: compiled traces never check hooks — a bare
  `while true do end` escaped the hook entirely — so installing the
  watchdog also forces `jit.off(); jit.flush()` and the VM runs
  interpreted while it's enabled; `watchdog_ms = 0` opts out and
  restores full JIT
- Process API (`tomoe.process.once/service/spawn`, ShojiWM-shape):
  declarative manifest diffed by id across reloads, restart/reload
  policies, 1 Hz supervision poll that also reaps fire-and-forget
  children (`process.rs`); builtin entries (reserved `tomoe:` id prefix,
  `Tomoe::declare_builtin_process`) ride the same manifest — the session
  bring-up chain is the first consumer
- IPC (doctrine 03): `tomoe-ipc` wire crate + `ipc.rs` calloop server —
  `tomoe msg` CLI, builtins (`version`/`windows`/`outputs`/`view`/
  `subscribe`/`quit`), `tomoe.ipc.serve` user endpoints running as normal
  Lua entries, `tomoe.ipc.broadcast` + core event stream (`window_open`,
  `window_close`, `focus_change`, `outputs_changed`); socket at
  `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/tomoe.<display>.sock`, `$TOMOE_SOCKET` exported and
  pushed to the activation environment
- Dogfood WMs: `wm.lua` (9 workspaces, dwindle, focus cycling),
  `zoomer.lua` (pan/zoom canvas, planes, drag move/resize)
- Compositor UI: `tomoe.ui` retained-widget registry (doctrine 05) —
  `confirm`/`menu`/`toast`/`sheet` widgets, core-rendered and
  core-routed (modal keyboard routing, sheet dismissal, toast expiry);
  only selection events re-enter Lua. Hotkey overlay, exit confirm, and
  config-error banner are builtins on the same registry; screenshot UI
  stays native (declared exemption until the API grows drag regions);
  xcursor themes; no-hooks full-screen fallback
- Session lock (ext-session-lock-v1, swaylock incl. crashed-locker
  fallback) and idle (ext-idle-notify + zwp-idle-inhibit, swayidle) —
  `lock.rs` + idle plumbing in `state.rs`
- xdg-activation: token validation + activate/urgent `on_window_request`
  events, native default focus, pre-map token stash (`handlers.rs`)
- XWayland via xwayland-satellite (niri-shape: tomoe owns the X11
  sockets/lock file, exports `DISPLAY` at startup, spawns satellite
  on-demand via `-listenfd` on first connection, respawns on next
  connection after a crash; `xwayland.rs`)
- Capture: wlr-screencopy v3 (shm + dmabuf, `copy` immediate,
  `copy_with_damage` queued per manager and completed from the redraw
  loop) and ext-image-copy-capture-v1 + ext-image-capture-source-v1
  (smithay handlers; output *and toplevel* sources — per-window renders
  crop to the xdg geometry, cursor embeds only while hovering, sessions
  renegotiate on window resize and stop on close; capture frames are
  queued and completed from the redraw loop, so casts pace to vblank
  instead of spinning); everything renders through one shared path in
  `capture.rs` on the primary GPU
- Foreign toplevels (`foreign_toplevel.rs`): ext-foreign-toplevel-list-v1
  (handles published on window map, title/app_id pushed on commit,
  `closed` on unmap — feeds bars and the portal's window enumeration) +
  wlr-foreign-toplevel-management-v3 (the taskbar control surface:
  states/outputs diff-refreshed once per loop iteration, control
  requests routed through `on_window_request` policy — new "close"/
  "unminimize" kinds — with xdg-matching native defaults)
- ScreenCast portal: `xdg-desktop-portal-tomoe` binary (zbus + pipewire,
  ShojiWM-shape: `PW_STREAM_FLAG_DRIVER | ALLOC_BUFFERS`, single thread,
  wlr-screencopy `ready` queues the PW buffer and kicks the next capture
  → vblank-paced); monitor sources (dmabuf with shm fallback) *and
  window sources* (ext-foreign-toplevel-list enumeration +
  ext-image-copy-capture streaming, shm, resize renegotiation via
  `update_params`); source choice asks the compositor first
  (`screencast_select` over IPC → `tomoe.on_screencast_request`, M4 §7),
  with the env-var heuristics (`TOMOE_SCREENCAST_OUTPUT` /
  `TOMOE_SCREENCAST_WINDOW` / `TOMOE_PORTAL_CHOOSER` dmenu lines /
  single-source auto) demoted to the no-hook fallback — the former
  doctrine-05 exemption is retired; compositor exports
  `XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP=tomoe` and, on TTY, pushes `WAYLAND_DISPLAY`/
  `DISPLAY`/`XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP`/`TOMOE_PORTAL_CHOOSER` into the
  systemd + D-Bus activation environment, pre-starts the GTK portal
  backend detached (it is a Wayland client of ours — blocking before the
  event loop deadlocks; and it must be up before the frontend activates,
  or NixOS's After= override deadlocks the frontend's synchronous
  backend calls), and try-restarts a stale frontend, so bus-activated
  backends find the session from a bare TTY launch; nix package ships
  `.portal` + `tomoe-portals.conf` + D-Bus service +
  `tomoe-session.target`. Session bring-up (start `tomoe-session.target`
  — its BindsTo pulls `graphical-session.target` up, systemd refuses
  starting that directly — then GTK backend, then frontend try-restart)
  runs as the builtin `tomoe:session-units` manifest entry; compositor
  exit stops the target (graphical-session.target follows,
  StopWhenUnneeded) and unsets the session env vars

## Gap inventory by reference

### vs niri (performance & session correctness)

- [x] presentation-time protocol (feedback rides the DRM frame as user data,
      fired from the vblank with the hardware timestamp; winit approximates
      with the compositor clock at submit)
- [x] Direct scanout for fullscreen surfaces; hardware cursor plane —
      `FrameFlags::ALLOW_PRIMARY_PLANE_SCANOUT_ANY | ALLOW_CURSOR_PLANE_SCANOUT`
      on the DrmCompositor render, plus per-surface render/scanout dmabuf
      feedback (niri-shape, NVIDIA compressed modifiers filtered from the
      scanout tranches per the standing lessons); engagement logged
      edge-triggered ("direct scanout engaged"). **Pending live
      verification**: fullscreen client on the primary plane via drm_info +
      the engage log; cursor-only motion not re-compositing
- [x] VRR (adaptive sync) per output (`settings.displays[..].vrr`, applied
      at connector bring-up and live-toggled on reload; explicit
      `use_vrr(false)` when unsupported/unwanted per niri's stale
      VRR_ENABLED workaround). Live verification pending (needs a
      VRR-capable monitor)
- [x] Tearing control (`wp_tearing_control_v1`) + async page flips
      (smithay fork `y0usaf/smithay#tomoe-tearing` = niri's pin + one
      async-flip commit; `settings.tearing` gates hint-requesting
      fullscreen windows, `TOMOE_FORCE_TEARING=1` for hint-less X11 games;
      live verification pending)
- [x] Output hotplug (udev → connector scan diff → connect/disconnect,
      reposition, `outputs_changed`)
- [x] Per-output position/mirror/disable (`settings.displays`: explicit
      physical `position`s anchor the layout and the rest packs after
      them; `mirror` maps at its target's position so it shows the same
      world region; `disabled` connectors stay stashed per device so a
      settings change re-enables them without a replug)
- [ ] Per-output scale (single global scale today; mixed-scale placement
      policy noted in DESIGN.md coordinate doctrine)
- [x] pointer-constraints + relative-pointer (games) — niri-shape: lock
      swallows motion, confine clamps at the surface/region edge, both keep
      sending relative motion; smithay deactivates on focus change
- [x] idle-notify + idle-inhibit (smithay's timers; activity fed from every
      input event, VT resume, and unlock, debounced per loop iteration;
      inhibitors honored only while their surface is mapped and the session
      unlocked)
- [x] ext-session-lock-v1 (niri-shape: `locked` confirmed only after every
      output rendered a locked frame; dark-red backdrop fallback; dead-locker
      replacement; locked scene also fed to all capture paths)
- [x] xdg-activation (niri-shape validation: serial-less tokens are
      urgency-only, serials checked against keyboard/pointer last-enter,
      10 s timeout + prune timer; requests route through
      `on_window_request` as "activate"/"urgent" so Lua policy decides —
      wm.lua consumes "activate" by switching to the window's workspace
      — native default focuses ("activate") or ignores ("urgent");
      tokens presented pre-map are stashed and honored at `add_window`)
- [x] Primary selection (focus follows keyboard focus, same as the clipboard)
- [x] libinput device config (tap, accel, natural scroll, DWT, scroll/click
      method…) via `settings.touchpad`/`settings.mouse`, per-device
      overrides in `settings.devices["<libinput name>"]`; unset fields
      revert to libinput defaults so reloads are idempotent
- [x] xkb config (rules/model/layout/variant/options) + key repeat via
      `settings.keyboard`, re-applied on change from any Lua entry
- [ ] Steady-state zoom re-advertises effective fractional scale
      (DESIGN.md camera follow-up)

### vs Hyprland (WM depth & eye-candy)

- [x] Popup grabs (anvil-shape: `grab_popup` + PopupKeyboardGrab/
      PopupPointerGrab, refused when another grab holds the device)
- [x] Fullscreen/maximize/minimize requests plumbed as Lua
      `on_window_request` events, policy decides; native default honors
      fullscreen on the window's output, acks maximize, ignores minimize
- [x] xdg interactive move/resize forwarded to Lua as `on_window_request`
      ("move"/"resize" + edges); a consuming hook takes over via
      `tomoe.grab_pointer` (the core releases the client's click grab),
      unconsumed drags are dropped
- [x] Focus-follows-mouse (`settings.focus_follows_mouse`, sloppy focus,
      no restack) + `on_pointer_enter/leave` hover events, suppressed
      while any pointer grab is active
- [x] Window rules (`tomoe.rule { app_id = ..., ... }`) — doctrine split:
      the core owns the matcher registry (app_id/title as Lua patterns,
      `match` predicate; all given must match) and runs `apply` functions
      when a matching window opens (after on_window_open hooks, so they
      refine WM placement — also in the native fallback and the reload
      replay); what data props *mean* stays policy — `tomoe.rules_for(win)`
      merges them (later rules win) and wm.lua honors `workspace = n`,
      `fullscreen = true`, `focus = false`. Per-window *core* props
      (tearing override, border colors) still need a queued-op surface —
      revisit with M6 eye-candy
- [x] Animation engine core (springs + beziers, niri's `animation` module
      with the clock stripped to explicit `now`): `animation.rs` —
      `Config`/`Animation` (spring | easing incl. cubic-bezier) +
      window-keyed `Animations` state on `Tomoe`. Doctrine split: Lua sets
      *target* geometry, the core animates the **rendered**
      position/alpha toward it — layout, input hit-testing, and the Lua
      snapshot always see the target. Wired: window_move (set_geometry
      delta → offset decays to 0, retargets compose so windows never
      jump) and window_open (alpha fade on map/show — show gives
      workspace switch-in fades for free). `settings.animations`
      (`false`, or per-property `{ spring = {damping_ratio, stiffness,
      epsilon} }` / `{ ease = {duration_ms, curve} }`). Rendering:
      offsets are integer-physical per frame (coordinate doctrine),
      alpha rides the element (smithay damage-tracks alpha changes);
      captures sample the same animated scene. Keepalive: backends call
      `animations.advance` per frame and re-queue while running (tty:
      `queue_redraw` → vblank-paced; winit: request_redraw). Verified
      nested: 400ms linear fade → grim mid-capture at expected ≈75%
      brightness, settles at 100%. Remaining slices: close animations
      (needs buffer retention past unmap), resize animation (shader,
      niri-style), workspace-switch slide (Lua-visible mechanism TBD),
      velocity-preserving retargets (`initial_velocity` is plumbed but
      always 0), TTY live check
- [x] Rounded corners (`settings.border.radius`, physical px) — niri-shape
      shader infra in `render/`: `shaders.rs` compiles per Gles context
      (winit init + TTY primary-GPU bring-up), `clipped_surface.rs` wraps
      the toplevel surface tree in a custom tex program (no offscreen —
      doctrine §5; popups never clip), `tomoe_render_elements!` macro
      replaces smithay's (RenderElement for the two concrete renderers,
      since draw needs the GlesFrame), per-window `ExtraDamage` bumps on
      radius change (uniforms are invisible to damage tracking).
      Fullscreen windows never round (keeps direct scanout — clipped
      elements return no underlying storage). Verified nested: all four
      corners AA'd, grim/screencopy path included. TTY live check pending.
      Follow-up: borders stay square — rounded borders need the border
      shader (with shadows); per-window radius needs the core-props op
      surface (below)
- [ ] Drop shadows
- [ ] Dual-kawase blur (windows + blur-behind for layer surfaces)
- [ ] Special workspaces / groups — Lua-level per policy split; needs
      mechanism audit (hide/show + per-window state suffice?)

### vs ShojiWM (extension surface)

- [x] Process API: `tomoe.process.once/service/spawn` declarative
      manifest, diffed by id, restart policies
      (`ref/ShojiWM/knowledges/process-api.md`) — `process.rs`
      ProcessManager + Lua manifest in `Shared`; 1 Hz polling supervision
      timer (only alive while children exist) doubles as crash-loop rate
      limit and zombie reaper; `tomoe.spawn` now reaps too
- [x] IPC: JSON socket + `tomoe msg` CLI + event stream +
      `tomoe.ipc.serve` for user-defined endpoints (bars/launchers) —
      `tomoe-ipc` wire crate (WIRE_VERSION, ShojiWM-shape ndjson frames)
      + calloop-hosted server in `ipc.rs`
- [x] Hot reload with state persistence: `tomoe.on_reload(name, save,
      restore)` (ShojiWM's onDisable/onEnable-with-persist shape, keyed by
      name so modules persist independently); `tomoe.window(id)` maps
      persisted ids back to handles; dogfooded by `wm.lua` (workspaces/
      active/fullscreen) and `zoomer.lua` (planes/cameras/fit)
- [x] Request events surfaced to Lua: maximize/minimize/fullscreen via
      `tomoe.on_window_request` (ShojiWM's `onWindow*Request` family);
      activate requests wait on xdg-activation (M5)
- [ ] Input-device change events (per-device *config* landed with M1 §5;
      the add/remove events + device query surface remain)
- [ ] Output reconfigure API (re-run config on hotplug, query available
      modes)
- [x] LuaLS `---@meta` annotation files shipped for editor DX —
      `resources/meta/tomoe.lua` covers the whole core API; parity +
      golden tests in `docgen.rs` hold it (and `docs/lua-api.md`) to the
      registered surface (`TOMOE_REGEN_DOCS=1` regenerates)
- [ ] Layer-surface events (`on_layer_create/update/destroy`) and
      reserved-insets query (usable_area exists; insets breakdown doesn't)
- [x] `tomoe.ui` — retained-widget overlay API (menu/confirm/toast/
      sheet): Lua declares the widget once (`ui/widgets.rs` registry),
      the core renders and damages it; only selection events re-enter
      Lua (as `Action::UiEvent` through `do_action`). Modal input
      routing generalized in `input.rs` (topmost modal owns the
      keyboard and swallows clicks; sheets dismiss on any input; toasts
      expire via a scheduled repaint). Exit dialog, hotkey overlay, and
      config-error banner ported as builtins (doctrine 05); screenshot
      UI stays native as the declared exemption
- [x] Portal source policy through the extension API:
      `tomoe.on_screencast_request` (snapshot in: `req.app_id`,
      `req.types`, `req.outputs`, `req.windows`; actions out: return a
      selection/false, or `req:defer()` + `req:resolve/deny` later) with
      the backend as a thin IPC client (`screencast_select`, 120 s
      timeout) — retires the `TOMOE_PORTAL_CHOOSER` env-var exemption;
      default `tomoe.ui.menu` picker ships as the preloaded `screencast`
      module, composing with `tomoe.rule { app_id = ..., screencast = ... }`
- [ ] Relative geometry/unit algebra across the Lua policy surface: accept
      `%` alongside exact physical `px` (and evaluate whether a logical
      `dp` unit is useful), with explicit reference boxes (`output`,
      `usable`, `parent`, `view`), anchors/alignment, aspect ratios,
      `contain`/`cover`/`stretch`, and min/max/clamp constraints. Apply the
      same vocabulary to window placement/resizing, tiling splits, gaps,
      margins, compositor UI, and later decorations; keep protocol,
      renderer, damage, capture, and final `Window:set_geometry` boundaries
      in deterministic integer physical pixels. Store relative layout
      intent so output hotplug/mode/scale/usable-area changes re-resolve it;
      define rounding/remainder ownership so adjacent tiles never gap or
      overlap. This is broader than niri's proportional columns and should
      follow ShojiWM's parent-relative/flex semantics without giving up
      Tomoe's physical-first coordinate doctrine.
- [ ] Scriptable decorations (long-term; Hyprland-style built-in borders/
      titlebar first, ShojiWM-style Lua-driven SSD tree later — study
      `ref/ShojiWM/knowledges/shared-edge-tree-plan.md` before designing)

### Ecosystem (all three have it)

- [x] **XWayland via xwayland-satellite (expedited → M2)** — landed; the
      rough edge it shook loose was the legacy `wl_drm` global (smithay's
      wl_drm kills Xwayland with a fatal "invalid format" protocol error),
      so `bind_wl_display` is gone from both backends — clients use
      linux-dmabuf. No Lua toggle yet; auto-enabled when the binary
      supports `--test-listenfd-support`
- [x] **Screencopy (expedited → M2)** — wlr-screencopy v3 (niri port) and
      ext-image-copy-capture-v1 (smithay handlers) both landed; verified
      with grim (shm copy) and wf-recorder (damage-queued frames at
      content rate). wf-recorder also forced linux-dmabuf v4 (default
      feedback) on the winit backend — it hard-binds v4
- [x] **Own xdg-desktop-portal backend (expedited → M2)** — landed:
      `crates/xdg-desktop-portal-tomoe`, ScreenCast over PipeWire built
      like ShojiWM's (DRIVER flag, vblank-paced), sidestepping the xdpw
      30fps bug (`ref/ShojiWM/knowledges/screencast-30fps-xdpw-bug.md`).
      Existing wlr portals remain usable as fallbacks alongside it
      (`tomoe-portals.conf` routes only ScreenCast to us)
- [x] Foreign-toplevel for bars/docks — ext-foreign-toplevel-list (with
      portal window capture) + wlr-foreign-toplevel-management v3
      (`protocols/wlr_foreign_toplevel.rs`, niri-shape but id-keyed and
      diff-based); every control request rides `on_window_request`
- [x] Gamma control / night light — wlr-gamma-control-unstable-v1
      (`protocols/gamma_control.rs`, niri's implementation verbatim in
      shape): one active control per output, every error path fails the
      resource *and* resets the LUT so a crashed daemon never leaves the
      screen tinted. LUT programming in the tty backend: atomic GAMMA_LUT
      blobs (`GammaProps`, previous blob kept for VT-switch restore) with
      the legacy gamma ioctl as fallback; gamma reset at connector
      connect, `pending_gamma_change` stashed while the session is
      inactive and applied/restored on `ActivateSession`; disconnect
      sends `failed`. Winit reports no gamma support. Live check pending
      (wlsunset/gammastep on a real session)
- [ ] text-input + input-method (IME) — after core parity
- [ ] Touch + tablet-v2 — deferred, no hardware pressure yet
- [ ] Virtual keyboard — deferred

### moonshell-driven (companion shell; see DESIGN.md "Companion project")

moonshell (`~/Dev/moonshell`, its PLAN.md "Interconnection tracker" is
the mirror of this list) is the first external `tomoe-ipc` consumer.
Items it pulls on:

- [x] Workspace/window event vocabulary sufficient for a bar — landed
      2026-07-08 with moonshell M3 §1, vocabulary only, zero wire
      change (doctrine 03's wire/vocabulary split, first real test):
      `wm.lua` serves **`wm_state`** (a bar's initial fetch) and
      broadcasts it after every workspace mutation (switch,
      move_focused, open/close, reload-restore). Payload:
      `{ active = n, workspaces = { { id, windows = count }, … } }` —
      all workspaces reported, display policy stays in the bar.
      Focused title rides core events (`windows` + `window_open/close`
      + `focus_change`). Verified live against moonshell's tomoe
      backend (nested winit instance). Known gap: no core event for
      *title changes* after open — a bar's focused-window title can go
      stale; add a `window_props_changed`-style core event when it
      itches
- [x] Window control surface for a taskbar (activate/close/minimize):
      landed as wlr-foreign-toplevel-management (M5 §1); equivalent
      `tomoe-ipc` methods can still come later if moonshell prefers the
      socket over the protocol
- [ ] Default moonshell bar config shipped as content alongside
      `wm.lua`, once moonshell M2 (Lua runtime) lands
- [ ] Combined home-manager module composing both flakes (post
      moonshell M3)

## Milestones (ordered)

### M1 — Finish Phase 3: a WM you can actually use daily

The stubs that break real apps, plus the input plumbing Lua policy needs.

1. ~~Popup grabs~~ done (highest impact: context menus)
2. ~~Fullscreen/maximize/minimize requests~~ done — `on_window_request`
   Lua events with a sane native default (fullscreen honored on the
   window's output); activate requests deferred to xdg-activation (M5)
3. ~~xdg move/resize grab forwarding~~ done — `on_window_request`
   "move"/"resize" events hand the drag to Lua's pointer-grab machinery
   (dogfooded by zoomer's CSD titlebar/edge drags)
4. ~~Focus-follows-mouse setting + `on_pointer_enter/leave` window
   events~~ done — hover diffing in `pointer_moved`; FFM is sloppy focus
   without restacking, hover state holds still during grabs/drags
5. ~~xkb config + libinput config~~ done — `settings.keyboard` (xkb +
   repeat, seat-side so it works on both backends) and
   `settings.touchpad`/`mouse`/`devices` per-device tables (tty backend
   tracks live libinput devices, re-applies on settings change and on
   hotplug/VT re-add)
6. ~~Primary selection; pointer-constraints + relative-pointer~~ done —
   primary selection piggybacks on keyboard-focus changes; constraints are
   enforced in the relative-motion path (lock = relative-only, confine =
   clamp at the edge), activation on motion/creation, cursor position hints
   honored
7. ~~presentation-time~~ done — feedback is the DRM frame's user data,
   presented from the vblank (HwClock when the kernel stamps it); verified
   against weston-presentation-shm on winit

*Accept: daily-drive with real apps — menus, dialogs, fullscreen video,
CSD titlebar drags — all behave; keyboard layout and touchpad configured
from Lua.*

### M2 — Daily-drive blockers: XWayland + screensharing (expedited)

Pulled forward from the old M4: with M1 done, these two are the only
things left between tomoe and full-time use. Session hardening and the
extension surface can wait; a compositor you can't share a screen from
or run X11 apps on cannot be daily driven.

1. ~~XWayland via xwayland-satellite~~ done — sockets/lock owned by
   tomoe, `DISPLAY` exported at startup, on-demand spawn via
   `-listenfd`, spawner thread waits and re-arms the watch on exit.
   What it shook loose: the legacy `wl_drm` global (removed — fatal
   "invalid format" error against Xwayland), verified with xeyes
   rendering through satellite
2. ~~wlr-screencopy~~ done — v3 with shm + dmabuf, immediate `copy` and
   redraw-loop-completed `copy_with_damage` (per-manager queues with own
   damage trackers, sync-fence-deferred `ready`). Verified: grim
   screenshots, wf-recorder records damage-paced frames. Side fix: winit
   backend now offers linux-dmabuf v4 with default feedback (wf-recorder
   binds v4 unconditionally)
3. ~~ext-image-copy-capture-v1~~ done — smithay's image_capture_source +
   image_copy_capture handlers; output sources via WeakOutput user-data,
   shm + dmabuf constraints (render formats of the primary GPU),
   constraint renegotiation and session stop on output changes. Globals
   verified advertised; frame path shares the screencopy render helpers.
   No cursor sessions yet (clients get embedded cursors via
   `paint_cursors`; separate cursor streams can come with the portal)
4. ~~Our own xdg-desktop-portal backend~~ done —
   `xdg-desktop-portal-tomoe` (zbus + pipewire, monitor sources): the
   pipeline is the ShojiWM port (DRIVER + ALLOC_BUFFERS, wayland fd on
   the PW loop, screencopy `ready` → `queue_buffer` → next capture, so
   pacing follows vblank, not the audio quantum); GBM dmabuf buffers
   with memfd/shm fallback; discovery ships in the nix package
   (`tomoe.portal`, `tomoe-portals.conf`, D-Bus activation) and the
   compositor now exports `XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP=tomoe`. Verified: builds
   through the flake, claims the bus, exports impl.portal.ScreenCast

*Accept: X11 app runs under satellite ✓; grim screenshots ✓; OBS/browser
screenshare captures at monitor refresh via our portal (built + bus
verified; end-to-end OBS fps check pending a real tomoe session), and
at least one third-party portal backend also works end-to-end (pending a
real-session xdg-desktop-portal-wlr run — the protocols it rides are in).*

### M3 — Session hardening (Phase 2 leftovers)

1. ~~Output hotplug end-to-end~~ done — udev → connector →
   `outputs_changed` → Lua reconfigure (ShojiWM's docked-monitor pattern
   is writable now)
2. ~~Per-output position/mirror/disable~~ done — `settings.displays`
   gains `position = {x, y}` (physical), `mirror = "<output>"`, and
   `disabled = true`, all live-reloadable; per-output *scale* still
   open (blocked on the DESIGN.md mixed-scale placement policy)
3. ~~ext-session-lock + idle-notify/idle-inhibit~~ done — `lock.rs` state
   machine (WaitingForSurfaces 1s grace → Locking → confirmed from the
   redraw path once every output shows a locked frame; dropping the
   confirmation is the abort path and sends `finished`); the locked scene
   replaces the normal one at all three scene-assembly sites (tty, winit,
   captures — screenshots/screenshares can't leak session content); input
   is gated to the lock surface while locked (VT switching stays live);
   idle timers are smithay's, fed activity from input/VT-resume/unlock and
   inhibited only by visible surfaces. Verified: swaylock lock → unlock,
   SIGKILL'd locker leaves the session locked on the backdrop and a new
   locker replaces it, grim captures only the locked scene, swayidle's
   timeout fires
4. Direct scanout for fullscreen + cursor plane; VRR; tearing control
   (mind `ref/ShojiWM/knowledges/fullscreen-direct-scanout-tearing.md`
   for the NVIDIA/async-flip pitfalls)
   - ~~Direct scanout + cursor plane~~ landed (plane flags + per-surface
     scanout dmabuf feedback in `backend/tty.rs`; overlay planes stay off,
     niri default). Scanout needs the fullscreen buffer opaque *and*
     spanning the output, or a black clear color — tomoe keeps its grey
     `CLEAR_COLOR`, so a translucent fullscreen client won't flip; swap
     the clear color to black under a fullscreen window if that ever
     matters. Live checks pending (drm_info, engage/disengage log)
   - ~~VRR per output~~ landed — `settings.displays[..].vrr` →
     `vrr_supported`/`use_vrr` at `connector_connected` (with the
     disable-anyway workaround for stale VRR_ENABLED) and a live diff in
     `apply_display_settings` (toggle queues a redraw — `use_vrr` is
     pending state applied on the next commit — without re-emitting
     `outputs_changed`, since no geometry changes). Tomoe's
     estimated-vblank timer needs no VRR awareness: it is only the
     no-damage safety net, not a presentation-time predictor like niri's
     frame clock. Live check pending (VRR-capable monitor +
     `drm_info` VRR_ENABLED)
   - ~~Tearing control~~ landed — smithay fork
     `github.com/y0usaf/smithay` branch `tomoe-tearing` (niri's pin
     ff5fa7df + one commit: `DrmSurface::page_flip(.., allow_tearing)`,
     `supports_async_page_flip()`, `DrmCompositor::queue_frame_tearing`
     with driver-rejection → synced-flip retry; rebase the branch when
     bumping the pin). Tomoe side: `wp_tearing_control_v1` global
     (passive hint store in surface data, ShojiWM port), and the tty
     render path tears when `settings.tearing` (or
     `TOMOE_FORCE_TEARING=1`, the testing/X11 escape hatch — satellite
     clients can't send the hint) + a fullscreen window on the output
     wants it + the cursor is hidden/elsewhere + the driver caps say so.
     Tearing frames drop `ALLOW_CURSOR_PLANE_SCANOUT` (async flips may
     only touch the primary plane — EINVAL otherwise), and
     `queue_redraw` promotes tearing surfaces out of
     `WaitingForEstimatedVBlank` straight to `Queued` so presents follow
     the client's commit rate, not the refresh period (§5 of the ShojiWM
     doc — the frame-bunching trap). Live checks pending: `tearing
     engaged` log + present cadence in a real game; per-window tearing
     override still open — M4 rules carry WM-level data only, a core
     window-prop op is future work

*Accept: laptop lid/dock cycles, lock screen, fullscreen game with direct
scanout confirmed via drm_info; no idle redraw storms.*

### M4 — Phase 4: extension-surface parity with ShojiWM

1. ~~Process API~~ done (`process.rs` + `tomoe.process` in Lua,
   ShojiWM-shape): manifest keyed by id, `once` (`run =
   "once_per_session"|"once_per_config_version"`), `service` (`restart =
   "never"|"on_failure"|"on_exit"`, `reload =
   "keep_if_unchanged"|"always_restart"`), fire-and-forget `spawn`;
   `command` = argv array or shell string (default: the id itself), `cwd`
   (config-relative), `env`. Reconcile runs from `after_lua` when the
   manifest changed; reload force-reconciles (fewer declarations = a diff
   that stops services) and bumps the config generation. Supervision is a
   1 Hz `try_wait` poll (per ShojiWM) — the tick period rate-limits crash
   loops; the timer exists only while children do (no idle wakeups);
   services are killed on compositor exit. ~~Session supervision +
   builtin consumers~~ landed: `tomoe-session.target` ships in the nix
   package (`share/systemd/user/`), started by the builtin
   `tomoe:session-units` `once` entry — one shell so ordering holds
   (target → GTK backend → frontend try-restart), running as a
   supervised manifest child instead of an orphaned background shell;
   exit stops the target and `unset-environment`s the session vars.
   Builtin mechanism: `Tomoe::declare_builtin_process` merges
   compositor-owned decls (reserved `tomoe:` prefix wins over user ids)
   into every reconcile. xwayland-satellite deliberately stays native —
   its fd handoff (`pre_exec` + `-listenfd`) and socket-activated
   respawn don't fit `ProcessSpec`, and growing the manifest for one
   consumer isn't worth it. Live checks pending:
   `graphical-session.target` active after a TTY launch and gone after
   exit; waybar-style service surviving a config reload with
   `keep_if_unchanged`; restart-after-crash cadence
2. ~~IPC socket + `tomoe msg` + event stream + `tomoe.ipc.serve`~~ done —
   doctrine-03 split: `crates/tomoe-ipc` holds the wire contract only
   (newline-delimited JSON `{id?, method, params?}` / `{id, result|error}`
   / `{event, payload}`, `WIRE_VERSION`, socket discovery, blocking
   client), the event *vocabulary* grows freely in the compositor/config.
   Server (`ipc.rs`) hosts each connection as its own calloop source
   (non-blocking reads, buffered writes, 1 MiB slow-reader drop à la
   niri). Builtins: `version`, `windows`, `outputs`, `view`, `subscribe`
   (opt-in event stream, optional `{events = [...]}` filter), `quit`;
   every other method dispatches to `tomoe.ipc.serve` handlers, which run
   as normal Lua entries (snapshot before, `after_lua` after; errors go
   back to the caller). `tomoe.ipc.broadcast` queues events (payload →
   JSON at call time), drained in `after_lua`. Core events: `window_open`
   / `window_close` / `focus_change` (deduped) / `outputs_changed`.
   Socket `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/tomoe.<display>.sock`, exported as
   `$TOMOE_SOCKET` (also into the systemd/D-Bus activation env for bars).
   Verified live on winit: all builtins, Lua echo endpoint, subscribe
   stream (broadcast + window open/close/focus on a real foot window),
   error paths, `quit` + socket unlink
3. ~~Hot reload with `on_reload` persist/restore~~ done —
   `tomoe.on_reload(name, save, restore)`: save hooks run in the outgoing
   VM (only after the new config loaded, so a broken config never
   disturbs the running one) and return JSON-compatible values — the only
   representation that outlives the VM; restore hooks run in the fresh VM
   with their key's value after load. The `on_window_open` replay remains
   as the fallback for configs that don't persist (restored + replayed
   would double-track windows, so it's either/or). `tomoe.window(id)`
   looks persisted ids back up. Verified live: window moved to workspace
   2 stays there across a reload (IPC-driven wm state dump)
4. ~~Window rules~~ done — `tomoe.rule` / `tomoe.rules_for` (mechanics in
   the Hyprland gap list above); the `screencast = ...` rule composition
   arrives with §7
5. ~~LuaLS meta files + example configs~~ done — parity-tested
   `resources/meta/tomoe.lua`; `resources/examples/` ships runnable
   configs (`tomoe --config <file>`): `extension-surface-init.lua`
   exercises the whole M4 surface (rules, process manifest, IPC
   endpoints + broadcasts via wrapped wm entry points, a scratchpad
   persisted through `on_reload`, `tomoe.ui` power menu, custom
   deferred-menu screencast policy) and `zoomer-init.lua` runs the
   canvas WM. Both are load-tested headless (`lua.rs`
   `example_configs_load` — loading is side-effect free by
   construction: spawns live in binds, manifest/ui/ipc registrations
   only queue), and the test asserts the extension-surface example
   actually registers rules/hooks/manifest/IPC/screencast/reload
   state, so the examples can't rot against the API
6. ~~`tomoe.ui` registry~~ done — retained widgets (`confirm`, `menu`,
   `toast`, `sheet`) on `ui/widgets.rs`, IDs session-unique so builtins
   survive reloads. Contract: constructors return a handle (`:close()`),
   callbacks live in the VM keyed by widget id, widgets close silently
   on config reload (Lua-owned only) and session lock; menu selection
   passes (1-based index, item). Builtins ported per doctrine 05: exit
   dialog = Confirm + `Action::ConfirmQuit` handler, hotkey overlay =
   Sheet built from binds at open (re-press toggles), config-error
   banner = urgent Toast; `screenshot_ui` stays native as the declared
   exemption until the API grows drag-region interaction. Menu pointer
   interaction landed: hovering a row moves the selection (menu geometry
   is cached separately from the pixel cache — selection changes recolor
   rows, never move them — so hit tests don't wait on a repaint), a left
   click on a row selects, elsewhere on the menu is swallowed, outside
   cancels; confirms stay keyboard-deliberate (Enter is the only way to
   confirm). Hit-testing rebases the pointer per output (widgets render
   centered on every output). Verified live on winit (toast/menu/
   confirm/sheet via IPC, handle close, builtin toggle); menu selection
   end-to-end (Enter or row click → on_select → broadcast) still needs
   a hands-on check — hit math is unit-tested, the routing untested by
   real input
7. ~~Portal source policy over IPC~~ done — `tomoe.on_screencast_request`
   (single slot, last registration wins): the portal's SelectSources
   sends `screencast_select` `{app_id, types}` over IPC (thin client,
   120 s read timeout) and the hook answers by returning
   `{ output = name }` / `{ window = win }` / `false`, or `req:defer()`
   + `req:resolve/deny` from a later Lua entry (menu callback) — replies
   ride a queued-op drain (`ipc::flush_screencast_replies` from
   `after_lua`), so the frame loop never waits. Window picks resolve to
   the foreign-toplevel identifier at flush time (gone window ⇒ deny);
   a config reload answers pending requests with `fallback` (resolvers
   died with the VM); disconnecting clients drop their pending entries.
   Default policy ships as the preloaded `screencast` module (required
   by the default init.lua): rules (`screencast = false | "DP-1"` on a
   window of the requesting app) → single candidate auto-resolve →
   deferred `tomoe.ui.menu`. No hook → `{action = "fallback"}` and the
   backend keeps the env-var heuristics (doctrine 06). Verified live on
   winit: hook resolve + post-reload fallback over `tomoe msg`; unit
   tests cover deny/defer/double-answer and the module's three tiers.
   **Pending live check**: real-session OBS pick through the portal
   (menu → PipeWire stream). Same hook pattern extends later to
   Screenshot and GlobalShortcuts (which maps 1:1 onto the bind
   registry)

*Accept: waybar-equivalent driven purely over user IPC; config reload
preserves workspace assignments; services survive and diff correctly;
the screencast picker is compositor-drawn via `tomoe.ui`, declared in
`init.lua`, and `TOMOE_PORTAL_CHOOSER` is no longer needed on a default
setup. — All landed.*

### M5 — Ecosystem remainder

1. ~~Foreign-toplevel for bars/docks~~ done —
   wlr-foreign-toplevel-management v3 (`protocols/wlr_foreign_toplevel.rs`,
   niri's module shape adapted from surface-keyed to window-id-keyed):
   the state stores the last-sent snapshot (title/app_id/maximized/
   fullscreen/activated/outputs) per window and a single diff refresh
   runs once per event-loop iteration (`refresh_wlr_foreign_toplevels`,
   `main.rs` loop callback — focus changes, commits, Lua ops, and unmaps
   all converge there; focused window refreshes last so listeners see
   deactivate-before-activate). "Activated" = keyboard focus (waybar/
   sfwbar treat it as *the* focused window, so at most one carries it,
   per niri). Control requests all ride `on_window_request` — activate
   (default: focus, same as xdg-activation), close (new kind; default:
   send_close), set/unset_fullscreen (defaults: the xdg fullscreen_default
   pair), set/unset_maximized (default: ack), set/unset_minimized
   ("minimize"/new "unminimize", no native default). `output_bound` sends
   the enters a late-bound wl_output missed. Verified live on winit:
   lswt lists windows; wlrctl focus moves keyboard focus (IPC-confirmed),
   close closes, minimize no-ops. Note: wlrctl 0.2.2 aborts on *empty*
   state arrays (its `wl_array_copy` trips libwayland≥1.24's sanity check
   on demarshaled arrays: data≠NULL, alloc=0) — not our bug; niri sends
   the same empty arrays and a state-less window is only expressible as
   an empty array
2. ~~xdg-activation~~ done — mechanics in the niri gap list above;
   activate/urgent ride the existing `on_window_request` policy path, so
   wlr-foreign-toplevel-management's activate (§1) can reuse it directly.
   Compositor-side token creation for `tomoe.spawn` (exporting
   `XDG_ACTIVATION_TOKEN` to children, niri-style) is still open — only
   matters once launchers run as compositor spawns. Live check pending:
   a real notification-click focus (needs a daemon + client that redeem
   tokens; global + request path verified nested)
3. ~~Gamma control / night light~~ done — wlr-gamma-control (mechanics in
   the Ecosystem gap list above); night-light policy stays in the daemon
   (wlsunset/gammastep), which can ship as a `tomoe.process.service`
   entry in user config. Live check pending: wlsunset on a tty session

*Accept: taskbar sees windows, activation focuses them, night light
works — all landed; live night-light run pending.*

### M6 — Phase 5: eye-candy

1. ~~Rounded corners~~ done — first slice, built the shader-element
   infrastructure the rest of M6 rides on (details in the Hyprland gap
   list above): `render/` now has per-context shader compilation
   (`shaders.rs`), Gles access through the renderer abstraction
   (`renderer.rs`: `AsGlesRenderer`/`AsGlesFrame` for GlesRenderer +
   TtyRenderer), the concrete-renderer element macro
   (`tomoe_render_elements!`), and damage injection for uniform-driven
   effects (`damage.rs`). TTY live check pending (verified nested on
   winit incl. screencopy)
2. ~~Animation engine (springs/beziers) driving layout positions +
   opacity~~ done — first slice (mechanics in the Hyprland gap list
   above): move offsets + open fades, `settings.animations`, per-frame
   advance/keepalive in both backends and the capture path. Open
   follow-ups (close/resize/workspace-switch animations, spring
   velocity on retarget, TTY live check) tracked in the gap list
3. [in progress] Borders polish, shadows, and remaining core props.
   - [x] Rounded borders: one persistent physical-first solid shader ring per
     mapped window, shared by GLES/TTY/capture; stable IDs and parameter
     damage, animation/camera zoom following, and fullscreen omission for
     direct scanout. Outer radius = window radius + border width.
   - [x] Shadows: persistent physical-first rounded SDF shader elements,
     Hyprland-shape range/color/power falloff, shared by GLES/TTY/capture;
     animation/camera following and fullscreen omission preserve direct scanout.
     Configured by `settings.shadow`; nested + TTY visual checks pending.
   - [x] Per-window radius/tearing/border-color queued-op surface:
     `Window:set_properties { radius, tearing, border = { focused,
     unfocused } }` replaces overrides atomically (empty table clears them),
     applies through the shared GLES/TTY/capture path, and lets rules grant
     hint-less XWayland tearing while retaining fullscreen/hardware gates.
     Overrides reset on config reload before restore/open replay, so removed
     rules cannot leak policy. Exercised by the extension-surface example;
     TTY tearing + visual decoration check pending.
4. [in progress] Dual-kawase blur incl. blur-behind for layer surfaces.
   - [x] First slice: cached dual-kawase framebuffer effect, physical rectangular
     layer-shell blur selected by exact namespace through `settings.blur`, shared
     by GLES/TTY/output capture.
   - [x] Second slice: the framebuffer effect's physical source box now includes
     an explicit `anti_artifact_margin` sampling halo (96 physical pixels by
     default), so Smithay invalidates and recaptures it for adjacent source
     damage; the expanded capture is cropped back to the requested rectangle.
     (`ref/ShojiWM/knowledges/effect-invalidation.md` re-read.)
   - [x] Third slice: `Window:set_properties { blur = true }` opts a window into
     the shared cached dual-kawase backdrop path (public Lua policy surface,
     exercised by the extension-surface example), with stable per-window effect
     identity across GLES/TTY/output capture. `ext-background-effect-v1` is
     advertised with blur capability; committed layer-surface regions are
     normalized after ordered add/subtract operations, clipped to surface bounds,
     and render as exact physical effect rectangles. Protocol regions opt in
     independently of namespace config and an explicit empty region disables the
     effect. Window blur is rectangular and disabled during camera zoom until
     transformed framebuffer-effect geometry lands. Rounded masks, popup/window
     protocol regions, nested + TTY visual checks remain.

*Accept: side-by-side with Hyprland defaults, no visible fidelity gap;
UFO test still flat at high refresh with animations running.*

### M7 — Resolution-independent policy geometry

1. Design and document a common Lua geometry value/algebra: `%` and `px`
   units, explicit reference boxes (`output`, `usable`, `parent`, `view`),
   anchors/alignment, aspect-ratio fitting (`contain`/`cover`/`stretch`),
   and min/max/clamp. Specify whether percentages include borders/gaps and
   specify deterministic physical-pixel rounding before implementation.
2. Add resolver primitives and relative layout intent to the Lua/core
   boundary. Re-resolve on output hotplug, mode, per-output scale, exclusive
   zone/usable-area, and parent/view changes; preserve exact integer-pixel
   `Window:set_geometry` as the low-level escape hatch and compositor
   boundary.
3. Dogfood the algebra in `wm.lua` and `zoomer.lua` for placement, resize,
   tiling splits, gaps, and margins; then use the same values for
   `tomoe.ui` and scriptable decorations rather than creating subsystem-
   specific percentage syntaxes.
4. Test ultrawide, 16:9, portrait, mixed-output, and fractional-scale cases,
   including `5120x1440 -> 50% x 50% -> cover/crop 16:9 = 1280x720`, and
   assert tiled rectangles exactly cover their parent without gaps or
   overlap after rounding.

*Accept: one declarative geometry vocabulary makes policy portable across
display shapes and scales, while rendering, protocols, capture, and all
final geometry remain crisp deterministic physical pixels.*

## Standing lessons from `ref/` (re-read before touching these areas)

- TTY loop wake/maintenance ordering:
  `ref/ShojiWM/knowledges/firefox-wayland-display-maintenance.md`
- Never regenerate cursor buffers per frame (false-damage redraw storm):
  `ref/ShojiWM/knowledges/tty-backend-notes.md`
- Redraw-loop spec: `ref/niri/docs/wiki/Development:-Redraw-Loop.md`
- Effect damage/invalidation policy design:
  `ref/ShojiWM/knowledges/effect-invalidation.md`
- LuaJIT debug hooks fire only from the interpreter — compiled traces
  never check them, so any hook-based execution limit silently misses a
  hot loop. Force `jit.off(); jit.flush()` while the hook is installed
  (see `LuaRuntime::watchdog`)
- Never bind the legacy wl_drm global (`bind_wl_display`): smithay's
  implementation posts a fatal "invalid format" protocol error at
  Xwayland, killing xwayland-satellite; linux-dmabuf covers every
  current client. Also: offer dmabuf **v4** (default feedback) on every
  backend — wf-recorder and friends hard-bind v4 and die on v3
