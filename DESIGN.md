# tomoe — design & roadmap

> **Tomoe** (巴, after Tomoe River — the legendary fountain-pen paper, a writing surface
> you return to again and again) — a surface that's yours to rewrite, like the
> compositor's hot-reloadable Lua config.
> Used as the binary, crate, `~/.config/tomoe/`, and Lua global name.

## Vision

A Wayland compositor that is:
- **As performant as niri** — render-on-damage with a per-output redraw state machine, direct scanout, DMA-BUF, VRR.
- **As feature-rich as Hyprland** — animations, blur/shadows/rounded corners, window rules, special workspaces, groups, tearing.
- **As configurable as ShojiWM** — config is a *program*, not a settings file: event hooks, custom layouts, scriptable decorations, process management, user-extensible IPC, hot reload with state persistence.

References live in `ref/` (niri 26.4.0, Hyprland 0.55.0, ShojiWM) and are the source of truth for patterns.

## Locked decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Core | Rust + Smithay, git rev `ff5fa7df392cecfba049ffed55cdaa4e98a8e7ef` | Same rev as niri 26.4 — the most battle-tested Smithay pin in existence |
| Config runtime | **Embedded Lua (mlua, LuaJIT, vendored)** | ShojiWM's capability surface without the out-of-process protocol machinery; single binary; µs-level hook calls; AwesomeWM/Neovim-proven. LuaLS `---@meta` annotations shipped for editor DX |
| Policy split | **Core-as-mechanism, dogfooded extension surface** (revised from "hybrid" after Phase 2): the Rust core exposes a large window/output/input/event API, and ALL WM policy — workspaces, tiling, focus order — ships as a default Lua library (`require("wm")`) built on that same public surface. Like Emacs/VS Code/pi: if our own WM can't be built on the API, the API isn't done | Guarantees the extension surface stays powerful; users can replace the entire WM, not just tune it. Native fallback: with no hooks registered, windows map full-screen so a broken config still shows something |
| Priorities | Daily-driveable core first, then eye-candy | User choice |
| XWayland | xwayland-satellite (niri/ShojiWM approach) | Avoids Hyprland's largest complexity sink |
| X11 clients, screencast | Later phases: wlr-screencopy + xdg-desktop-portal | |

### Coordinate doctrine (physical-first)

Niri's sharpness comes from a discipline: every element lands on an integer
physical pixel, so client buffers are sampled 1:1 (no resampling → crisp
text). Niri enforces it by convention — fractional logical coordinates plus
rounding helpers every code path must remember to call. Tomoe enforces the
same invariant *structurally*:

1. **The canonical coordinate space is integer physical pixels.** Layout, the
   Lua API, window/output bookkeeping (`space.rs`, our replacement for
   smithay's integer-*logical* `Space`), and render element positions are all
   `i32`/`Point<i32, Physical>`. Integers on the physical grid cannot
   misalign; there is no rounding to forget.
2. **All logical↔physical conversion lives in `coords.rs`** — nowhere else.
   Protocol objects that speak logical (xdg configure sizes, wl_output
   geometry, pointer events) convert exactly once at that boundary.
3. **Window body sizes are quantized at the boundary.** xdg configure sizes
   are integer logical, so at scale `s` clients can only produce buffers of
   `round(n·s)` physical pixels (`coords::configure_size`). No architecture
   escapes this — it's baked into the protocol. Compositor-drawn pixels
   (borders, gaps, UI) are free at any physical integer, which is why a
   1-device-pixel border works at any scale.
4. **Scale is snapped to N/120** (`coords::snap_scale`), the only granularity
   wp-fractional-scale-v1 can express; wp-viewporter + fractional-scale are
   advertised so clients render at native density from their first buffer.
5. **No offscreen intermediates.** Effects that render windows into a texture
   first (blur, rounded-corner passes) are a chance to resample; Phase 5
   effects must keep intermediate framebuffers pixel-aligned too.
6. **The camera is the one sanctioned resampling path.** Windows (and their
   borders) live on a world-coordinate canvas viewed through a per-space
   camera (`tomoe.set_view`): `screen = (world − offset) · zoom`. The offset
   is integer physical, so pan and the identity view keep every element on
   the grid; at `zoom ≠ 1` windows render through `RescaleRenderElement`
   (GPU-resampled — meant to be transient, e.g. a zoomable-canvas WM's
   overview). Layer-shell, compositor UI, and the cursor are screen-fixed.
   Input stays in screen space; window hit-testing inverts the camera and
   compensates the surface origin handed to the seat, so clients receive
   exact buffer-local coordinates at any pan/zoom. Follow-up for crisp
   steady-state zoom: re-advertise the effective fractional scale at rest so
   clients re-render at native density.

Currently one scale applies to all outputs (`tomoe.settings { scale }`);
per-output scale is a later, local change — it belongs in the existing
per-output `settings.displays` table (which already holds `resolution`,
`position`, `mirror`, and `disabled`).
Known follow-ups: compositor UI font sizes don't multiply by scale yet, and
output logical positions for mixed-scale multi-head need a placement policy.

### Performance keystones (from the references)

1. **Per-output redraw state machine** (`Idle / Queued / WaitingForVBlank / WaitingForEstimatedVBlank`)
   — the single biggest reason niri is smooth at high refresh where Hyprland/Anvil stutter. ShojiWM's own
   investigation confirms this: `ref/ShojiWM/knowledges/high-refresh-investigation.md`. Spec:
   `ref/niri/docs/wiki/Development:-Redraw-Loop.md`. Adopt from Phase 1 (simplified) onward.
2. Render only on damage; never redraw idle outputs; frame callbacks throttled per output sequence.
3. The render loop **never blocks on Lua**. Hooks run as calloop-scheduled callbacks with an
   instruction-count watchdog (Lua debug hooks) so a runaway config cannot hang the frame.
4. Direct scanout + overlay planes, VRR, tearing (immediate flips) in the TTY backend (Phase 2+).

### Extension-surface contract

- Lua never borrows compositor state: reads come from a snapshot the core refreshes
  before every Lua entry; writes are queued ops (`set_geometry/show/hide/focus/close`)
  applied when the callback returns. The frame loop never waits on Lua.
- Window objects are userdata handles (id-based, `__eq` by id) with properties
  (`app_id`, `title`, `geometry`) and methods; events (`on_window_open/close`,
  `on_focus_change`, `on_outputs_changed`) drive policy.
- The default WM (`resources/wm.lua`, preloaded as module `"wm"`) implements
  workspaces 1-9 + dwindle tiling + focus cycling purely on this API. It is loaded
  only when config `require`s it — replaceable wholesale.
- A second dogfood WM ships as module `"zoomer"` (`resources/zoomer.lua`,
  after ~chld/shko): floating windows on a pannable/zoomable canvas with
  planes, Mod+drag move/resize, Mod+scroll zoom — proof the pointer-hook,
  grab, raise, and camera mechanisms suffice for a wholly different paradigm.
- Configs are modifier-agnostic: binds and pointer hooks say `Mod`
  (`"Mod+Return"`, `ev.mods.mod`), and `tomoe.settings { mod = "alt" }`
  declares once what Mod means (default: super).

### Lua API surface (target; grows per phase)

```lua
tomoe.settings { gaps = 8, mod = "super", focus_follows_mouse = true }
tomoe.bind("Mod+Return", function() tomoe.spawn("foot") end)
tomoe.bind("Mod+1", "workspace 1")              -- built-in actions as strings
tomoe.on_window_open(function(win) ... end)      -- hooks: open/close/focus/output/...
win:raise()                                       -- restack above all others
tomoe.on_pointer_button(function(ev) ... end)    -- return true to consume; ev has
tomoe.on_pointer_axis(function(ev) ... end)      --   world/screen pos, mods, window
tomoe.on_pointer_enter(function(win) ... end)    -- hover changed window; leave fires
tomoe.on_pointer_leave(function(win) ... end)    --   first, suppressed during grabs
tomoe.on_window_request(function(ev) ... end)    -- client fullscreen/maximize/minimize/
                                                  --   move/resize asks; consume or default
tomoe.grab_pointer(on_motion [, on_release])     -- route motion to Lua until release
tomoe.set_view { x = 0, y = 0, zoom = 1.5 }      -- camera over the window canvas
tomoe.view(); tomoe.pointer()                   -- camera + pointer (world & screen)
tomoe.rule { app_id = "mpv", floating = true }   -- rules as data or as functions
tomoe.register_layout("fibonacci", fn)           -- custom layout, same trait as built-ins
tomoe.workspace(2).layout = "scrolling"
tomoe.process.service("waybar", { restart = "on-exit" })  -- ShojiWM-style manifest
tomoe.ipc.serve("mybar", handler)                -- user-extensible IPC
tomoe.on_reload(snapshot_fn, restore_fn)         -- hot reload with state persistence
```

## Roadmap

- **Phase 1 (now): skeleton that runs.** Flake devshell; winit backend; GlesRenderer +
  OutputDamageTracker; xdg-shell windows mapped and tiled (dwindle first); keyboard/pointer;
  Lua config with binds/spawn/hooks/settings. *Accept: spawn two terminals, they tile, keybinds work.*
- **Phase 2: TTY.** DRM/GBM/libinput/libseat session backend, multi-output, output config from Lua,
  full redraw state machine, presentation-time. *Accept: daily-drive login session.*
- **Phase 3: WM depth.** Mechanism sufficient to build any layout in Lua (per the
  policy split, layouts themselves are Lua libraries, not core features): fullscreen/
  maximize request plumbing ✓, focus-follows-mouse events ✓, xdg move/resize grab
  forwarding ✓, per-output workspace support in `wm.lua`, layer-shell ✓, z-order ✓,
  pointer hooks + Lua grabs ✓, view camera ✓ (dogfooded by the `zoomer` module).
- **Phase 4: IPC + tooling.** JSON socket (`tomoe msg`), event stream, `tomoe.ipc.serve`,
  LuaLS meta files, hot reload with snapshot/restore.
- **Phase 5: Eye-candy.** Borders/rounded/shadows (shader elements), dual-kawase blur,
  animation engine (springs + beziers, Hyprland-style AnimatedVariable on layout positions).
- **Phase 6: Ecosystem.** xwayland-satellite integration, screencopy + portal, gamma/night-light,
  idle/lock protocols, VRR/tearing polish, custom Lua layouts API stabilization.
